[Check out the online demo!](http://artifaces.leschatscosmiques.net)

> Craft thy own Japanese 19th century fireworks 
> Pop colors and zwims and zamms  
> Explode 

Yokohama city's public library hall released dematerialized versions of old catalogues of firework (www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/kyoiku/library/digitalarchive/hirayama.html).
We could not resist the urge of detouring them to offer everyone the beautiful experience of Japanese fireworkks, with a little help from the team that conceived the generator of medieval Bayeux tapestries.

## Features
This brand new Historic Tale Construction Kit allows you to
* Drag, drop, scale, rotate any item from the Bayeux image bank
* Do the same with text with different fonts and colors
* Bring elements to the front/back of the scene (this is life changing)
* Work on several images (pages) at once
* Export those pages as PNG or as GIF
* Save a working copy of your tapestry to your disk, to finish it later
* Use brushes to quickly add crowds, birds, or battlefield
* Use keyboard shortcuts for almost all of the above
* Download a standalone version to use it anywhere without any server

### Universe
This kit is based on the Bayeux Tapestry (http://www.bayeuxmuseum.com/en/la_tapisserie_de_bayeux_en.html), a 70-meters long piece of art telling the story of the Battle of Hastings. However, every Bayeux-related pictures, fonts and settings are stored in a single folder, that can be easily swapped with, say, Japanese Prints, Cave Painting, whatever your heart desires.

Feel free to fork this project and create your own Historic Tale Construction Kit with anything that comes to mind :) see how on the project's repository !
